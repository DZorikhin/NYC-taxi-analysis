# NYC-taxi-analysis
New York City yellow taxi project (python, pandas, seaborn)

In this assignment I worked with NYC Taxi & Limousine Comission Trip Data (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).
I used yellow taxi dataset for the latest month available (June 2018 data were used).

Questions I covered:
1. How does average trip duration in minutes change during the week?
2. Take only the trips between different boroughs. Which pair of different boroughs results in the highest average trip fare?
3. Drivers are unsatisfied with fares from Manhattan during evening peak hours on working days. Management team wants to introduce subsidies ($X per ride) in such hours. Identify which hours are most likely the problem ones and estimate possible value of X considering monthly budget of $6mln.
